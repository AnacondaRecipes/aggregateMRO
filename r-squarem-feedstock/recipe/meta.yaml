  summary: Algorithms for accelerating the convergence of slow, monotone sequences from smooth,
    contraction mapping such as the EM algorithm. It can be used to accelerate any smooth,
    linearly convergent acceleration scheme.  A tutorial style introduction to this
    package is available in a vignette on the CRAN download page or, when the package
    is loaded in an R session, with vignette("SQUAREM").
