  summary: Different kinds of tests for linear mixed effects models as implemented in 'lme4'
    package are provided. The tests comprise types I - III F tests for fixed effects,
    LR tests for random effects. The package also provides the calculation of population
    means for fixed factors with confidence intervals  and corresponding plots. Finally
    the backward elimination of non-significant effects is implemented.
