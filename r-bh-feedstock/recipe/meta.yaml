  summary: 'Boost provides free peer-reviewed portable C++ source  libraries.  A large part of
    Boost is provided as C++ template code which is resolved entirely at compile-time
    without linking.  This  package aims to provide the most useful subset of Boost
    libraries  for template use among CRAN package. By placing these libraries in  this
    package, we offer a more efficient distribution system for CRAN  as replication
    of this code in the sources of other packages is  avoided. As of release 1.65.0-1,
    the following Boost libraries are included: ''algorithm'' ''align'' ''any'' ''atomic''
    ''bimap'' ''bind'' ''circular_buffer'' ''compute'' ''concept'' ''config'' ''container''
    ''date''_''time'' ''detail'' ''dynamic_bitset'' ''exception'' ''filesystem'' ''flyweight''
