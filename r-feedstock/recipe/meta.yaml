    about:

      license: GPL-2
      summary: The goal of checkpoint is to solve the problem of package reproducibility in R. Specifically,
        checkpoint allows you to install packages as they existed on CRAN on a specific
        snapshot date as if you had a CRAN time machine. To achieve reproducibility, the
        checkpoint() function installs the packages required or called by your project and
        scripts to a local library exactly as they existed at the specified point in time.
        Only those packages are available to your project, thereby avoiding any package
        updates that came later and may have altered your results. In this way, anyone using
        checkpoint's checkpoint() can ensure the reproducibility of your scripts or projects
        at any time. To create the snapshot archives, once a day (at midnight UTC) Microsoft
        refreshes the Austria CRAN mirror on the "Microsoft R Archived Network" server (<https://mran.microsoft.com/>).
        Immediately after completion of the rsync mirror process, the process takes a snapshot,
        thus creating the archive. Snapshot archives exist starting from 2014-09-17.

      license: MIT + file LICENSE
      summary: A fast JSON parser and generator optimized for statistical data and the web. Started
        out as a fork of 'RJSONIO', but has been completely rewritten in recent versions.
        The package offers flexible, robust, high performance tools for working with JSON
        in R and is particularly powerful for building pipelines and interacting with a
        web API. The implementation is based on the mapping described in the vignette (Ooms,
        2014). In addition to converting JSON data from/to R objects, 'jsonlite' contains
        functions to stream, validate, and prettify JSON data. The unit tests included with
        the package verify that all edge cases are encoded and decoded consistently for
        use with dynamic data in systems and applications.
