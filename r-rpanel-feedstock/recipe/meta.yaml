  summary: rpanel provides a set of functions to build simple  GUI controls for R functions.  These
    are built on the tcltk package.  Uses could include changing a parameter on a graph
    by animating it  with a slider or a "doublebutton", up to more sophisticated control  panels.
    Some functions for specific graphical tasks, referred to as 'cartoons', are provided.
