  summary: Efficient algorithms for fitting the regularization path of linear or logistic regression
    models with grouped penalties.  This includes group selection methods such as group
    lasso, group MCP, and group SCAD as well as bi-level selection methods such as the
    group exponential lasso, the composite MCP, and the group bridge.
