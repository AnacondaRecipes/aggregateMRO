  summary: A powerful and elegant high-level data visualization system inspired by Trellis graphics,
    with an emphasis on multivariate data. Lattice is sufficient for typical graphics
    needs, and is also flexible enough to handle most nonstandard requirements. See
    ?Lattice for an introduction.
